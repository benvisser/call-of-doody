## Email 2: Day 3
```
Subject: Why we built this (it's personal)

Hey [NAME],

Quick story...

Last summer, I was on a road trip with my kids.
Mile 200. Middle of nowhere.
My 4-year-old says those magic words: "I have to GO."

The next 23 miles were... stressful.

When we finally found a gas station, the bathroom was CLOSED.

That's when I said: "There has to be an app for this."

There wasn't. So we built one.

Call of Doody is almost ready. And you're one of the first people who'll get it.

Thanks for being here,
[Founder name]

P.S. Have a bathroom horror story? Reply and share it. We read every one.
